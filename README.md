## COMP6200 Final project of Data Science (Group "Y")


### Name of the project: A study of socio-economic factors affecting the COVID-19 cases


### Data sources for project:

The datasets collected for analysis has been taken from the following sources:


* [Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering(CSSE)](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series)

* [Factors data countrywise(2018)](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator)
> countrywise literacy rate,GDP,elderly population,CDR,life expentancy at birth to be downloaded


### Models Specifications:

* Socio economic variables of different countries to be taken into consideration for predictive model:
    * Literacy rate 
    * GDP
    * Eldery population(65+)
    * Crude death rate
    * Total Population
    * Life expentancy at birth


### Predictive Models use in project:

* Multiple linear regression and polynomial regression will be used to assess the effect of different socio economic variables on:
    * Total no. of confirmed cases
    * Total no. of deaths cases
    * Total no. of recovered cases

* Classification model for total number of confirmed,recovered and deaths using socio economic variables

* ARIMA model can be applied to access time-series data.
